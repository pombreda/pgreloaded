    Creates a BitmapFont suitable for bitmap to character mappings.
    
    The BitmapFont class uses an image surface to find and render font
    character glyphs for text. It requires a mapping table, which
    denotes the characters available on the image.

    The mapping table is a list of strings, where each string reflects a
    'line' of characters on the image. Each character within each line
    has the same size as specified by the size argument.

    A typical mapping table might look like

      [ '0123456789',
        'ABCDEFGHIJ',
        'KLMNOPQRST',
        'UVWXYZ    ',
