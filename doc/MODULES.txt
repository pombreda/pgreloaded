============================
Creating modules for Pygame2
============================

Creating a new module is a piece of cake. In order to maintain a similar
layout for all modules, you should respect some minor rules.

C Modules
---------
Create an new directory under src, using the name of the module you
would like to create (see below, :ref:`cmodulenaming`). All source files
related to your module should go into that directory (and stay there!).
You should use the Python 2.5 and 3.1 API for programming. In order to
support Python 2.4, include the "pgcompat.h" header file, where
appropriate.

.. _cmodulenaming:

C Module Naming
---------------
In case the module is a wrapper around an existing library, the module's
should be similar to that of the library. The module name should be all
lowercase and do not have any other characters besides a-z in its name.

Example: ::

  SDL_gfx  -> sdlgfx
  SDL      -> sdl
  MyOwnLib -> myownlib
  ...

The module (or modules) source files should match the following naming
conventions: ::

  Module C source:  MODULENAMEmod.c
  C API header:     pgMODULENAME.h
  Classes:          CLASSNAME.c

The file names are all lowercase, MODULENAME has to be replaced with the
name of the module (see above), CLASSNAME is the name of the class to
wrap. Both are not absolutely strict in their convention, but it should
be easy to determine the module header, module code and class code files
on a first glance, without looking at the contents of the files.

Example: ::

  Module C source: sdlimage -> sdlimagemod.c, imagemod.c, ...
  C API header:    sdlimage -> pgsdlimage.h, pgimage.h, ...
  Classes:         Surface -> surface.c,
                   Mask -> mask.c

Make sure, the C API header does not conflict with another header to be
installed. Headers used on the module scope only (internally used
headers) can be named as you like. The C API headers should use the "pg"
prefix to avoid naming issues with system or 3rd party library headers.

C API
-----
To import a module from C code, import_pygame2_MODULENAME_SUBMODULE() or
import_pygame2_MODULENAME() should be used, where MODULENAME has to be
replaced with the name of the module and SUBMODULE with an existing
submodule.

  +-------------------+----------------------------+
  | pygame2.sdl.video | import_pygame2_sdl_video() |
  +-------------------+----------------------------+
  | pygame2.sdlttf    | import_pygame2_sdlttf()    |
  +-------------------+----------------------------+
  | ...               | ...                        |
  +-------------------+----------------------------+  

The rest of the C API should follow the Python naming conventions. You
can take a look at the existing headers for examples on how to do it.
If you have plain C functions you would like to become an own C library,
use the pyg\_ prefix to indicate it. Those functions must not have any reference
to the Python API and should be seperated from the rest of the code so that
merging them into an own library is as easy as possible.

Example (see src/sdlext, draw.c and draw.h): ::

    int pyg_draw_aaline (...);
    int pyg_draw_line (...);
    ...
  
C Module Build System
---------------------
Add your newly created module to the modules list in modules.py. Doing
that is pretty straight forward and should not be too complex. A new
entry looks like this: ::

  Module ("MODULENAME", [ "SOURCEFILE.c", "SOURCEFILE.c", ... ],
          [ "pgCAPIHEADER.h", "pgCAPIHEADER.h", ...], "DOCFILE.xml",
          ['DEPENDENCY1', 'DEPENDENCY2', ...])

In case you have submodules, you would split anything according to your
needs. You can see how submodules are added by looking at the various
sdl.XXX modules. Aside from that MODULENAME will be replaced with the
name of your module, SOURCEFILE with the source file(s) of your module,
including the full path to them. The pgCAPIHEADER.h list is only
necessary, if you have C API header files to install. pgCAPIHEADER.h then
will be replaced with the name and full path of the header file(s) to
install.
DOCFILE.xml is the name of the documentation file to use, which is located
under doc/src (see below, :ref:`documenting`).
Each entry in the DEPENDENCY list represents an external library reference
which must be linked with the module. The names of these libraries can be
found/modified in the config.config_modules file.

.. note::

   If the module is not fully implemented yet or in an unstable or untested
   form, mark it as experimental, so that it will not be built and included
   in default releases, but only in SCM-based builds.
   To do this, simply add the ``experimental=True`` parameter to the ``Module``
   constructor.

Example: ::

  Module ("myownlib",[ "src/myownlib/myownlibmod.c", "src/myownlib/myclass.c" ],
                     [ "src/myownlib/pgmyownlib.h" ], "myownlib.xml", ['SDL'])


If you need to define a new library reference, you may do so in the dependencies
dictionary in config.config_modules ::

    'dependency_name' : 
        dep(['header.h', header2.h, ...], 'library_id', ...),

When defining a new dependency, 'dependency_name' is its full name (as
referenced when instantiating a new Module object), [ 'header.h', ... ] is a
representative list of required headers for the library, and 'library_id' is
the linking id for the library: For example, a library that is linked with
'-ljpeg' has 'jpeg' as its id.

All the modules which depend on such library will be automatically
configured and built using it.

Additionally, you may disable/enable the compilation of such library
(and hence of all the modules which rely on it) by adding an entry to
the 'build' dictionary in the cfg.py module ::

    build['dependency_name'] = False

C Module Dependencies
---------------------
If you have inter-module dependencies (e.g. parts of pygame.myownlib can make
use of pygame.sdl.video), you have to check, whether the specific module is
available. In your C code, you can test for certain defines, which ease this
process. Each module creates a HAVE_PYGAME_MODULENAME define to test for.
To check for e.g. pygame.sdl.video, you can use::

  #ifdef HAVE_PYGAME_SDL_VIDEO
    /* Code that relies upon pygame.sdl.video */
  #endif

Make sure, you load the correct modules within the module initialization
function. Take a look at the src/mask/maskmod.c module file for an example.

Build Environment Dependencies
------------------------------
If it is necessary to rely on certain features specific to a particular
environment, you can check for the build system flags, which are automatically
added at compile time. Currently, the following flags are available:

  +-----------+----------------------------------------+
  | IS_WIN32  | Win32 build with Visual C++            |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------+
  | IS_MSYS   | (Win32) Msys build with GCC            |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------+
  | IS_DARWIN | MacOS X and Darwin-based platforms     |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------+
  | IS_UNIX   | Any other build platform that          |
  |           | successfully passes the preparations   |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------+
  
You can easily check for those flags in the C code using the usualy
preprocessor magic: ::

  #ifdef IS_WIN32 
    /* Visual C++ specific Win32 instructions */
  #elif defined(IS_MSYS)
    /* GCC/Msys specific Win32 instructions */
  #elif defined(IS_UNIX)
   /* Unix specific instructions */
  #elif defined(IS_DARWIN)
   /* Darwin specific instructions */
  #endif

Python Modules
--------------
Python modules have no special restriction, but should follow the
typical python conventions. The files should be named all lowercase and
be placed under lib.

.. _documenting:

Documenting
-----------
As written above (see "C module build system"), the documentation files
reside in doc/src/. They are all XML files and must have a ".xml" suffix
in order to be recognized by the documentation build system.

Python Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you have written your module, you can create a documentation template for
it using the create_doc.py script. Simply type ::

  python create_doc.py pygame2.myownlib myownlib.xml
  
to create the documentation file for the myownlib module. This will create
a skeleton with all classes, functions, methods and attributes of your module.

If you documented your python code properly, there won't be any empty sections
within the documentation ;-).

C Modules 
^^^^^^^^^
C Modules require the documentation to be available at compile time,
which involves two steps to set up the initial documentation. The
documentation system creates C header files from the XML files
automatically at build time to allow their usage from within the C code.

To make use of them, you can include the "DOCFILE_doc.h" header, which will
be generated as soon as a proper "DOCFILE.xml" file is found by the build
system. In case you create a new module from scratch, we recommend you
to copy the api_template.xml file to your DOCFILE.xml and create the XML
documentation as you develop the C code. See below for the C constants to use.

If you have an already written module, integrate it first (as described above),
then run the create_doc.py script on it: ::
 
  python create_doc.py pygame2.myownlib myownlib.xml

This will create a XML documentation file including the documentation
you already wrote for the module. A second step now will require you to
remove the documentation from the code and use the API constants which
will be generated by the documentation system. Include the
"DOCFILE_doc.h" header file, then use the proper constants for all
things to document.

C Documentation Constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The C constants are generated using the DOC_MODULENAME_CLASSNAME_NAME scheme.
The following constants are used:

  +----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | DOC_MODULENAME             | The documentation for the module.         |
  +----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | DOC_MODULENAME_FUNCNAME    | The documentation for a module function.  |
  +----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | DOC_MODULENAME_CLASSNAME   | The documentation for a class.            |
  +----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | DOC_MODULENAME_CLASSNAME_X | The documentation for a class method or   |
  |                            | attribute.                                |
  +----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Take a look at the src/base code to learn more about it.
