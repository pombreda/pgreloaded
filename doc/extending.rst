Extending Pygame2
#################

The following sections provide a brief overview about the most important
steps for extending pygame2 by new modules. These cover the thing like
module and source file naming, the incorporation in the module build
system, documentation issues and environment specific settings.

A short FAQ with pointers to the most important header files, macros,
and do's and dont's is provided, too. Make sure you have read and
understand both before hacking.
