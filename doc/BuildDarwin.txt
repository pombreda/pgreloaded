Building Pygame2 on Darwin
==========================
Building PyGame 2 on Darwin platforms (e.g. Mac OS X) is quite similar
to building it in any other Unix-based platform with the following
exceptions:

Setting the environment
-----------------------
You will need the Darwin port of GCC and the Make utility; these
programs are automatically installed with XCode/Apple's Developers
Tools. These can be found on your second installation CD or on Apple's
homepage.

Building the dependencies
-------------------------

Make sure, you have at least one of the following Python versions installed:

* Python 2.5 (bundled with Mac OS X)
* Python 2.4, 2.6, 3.1 (http://www.python.org)

These versions must be installed as Frameworks: Mac OS 10.5 already
comes with Python 2.5 installed as a framework; be careful when
installing other versions: either compile them from source (safest
option) or download the appropiate precompiled builds, making sure they
do a proper Python install under Mac OS X (i.e. as framework).

To build anything, you will have to download the following additional source
packages:

* SDL >= 1.2.10              (http://www.libsdl.org)
* SDL_mixer >= 1.2.11        (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
* SDL_ttf >= 2.0.9           (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
* SDL_image >= 1.2.10        (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
* SDL_gfx >= 2.0.18          (http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/)
* libpng >= 1.2.24           (http://www.libpng.org)
* libjpeg >= 6b              (http://www.ijg.org/)
* freetype >= 2.3.5          (http://www.freetype.org)
* portmidi >= 199            (http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/)
* OpenAL                     use one of:
    
  * OpenAL11CoreSDK (Aug 2009) http://www.openal.org 
  * openal-soft >= 1.11.753    http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html

And you will need the dependency packages for the packages above:

* zlib >= 1.2.3              (http://www.zlib.net)
* tiff >= 3.8.2              (http://libtiff.org)
* libvorbis >= 1.2.0         (http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/)
* libogg >= 1.1.3            (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/)
* FLAC >= 1.2.1              (http://flac.sourceforge.net)
* smpeg >= rev. 370          (http://icculus.org/smpeg/)

Where available, the prefered way to install these dependencies is by
downloading prebuilt Framework packages: These can be downloaded for all
the SDL and SDL-dependant libraries, and they just need to be copied
into your System's Library/Framework folders, as instructed in their
respective READMEs. The build script will automatically detect them.

When Framework packages are not available, the suggested approach is to
download the library sources and build them yourself.

Optionally, you may want to use a 'ports' package manager for Mac OS X
such as MacPorts or Fink to automatically download all
dependences. However, be noted that you will need to modify the build
scripts/configuration that these programs generate, since they usually
compile the downloaded libraries for your installed architecture (either
PPC or x86): In order to link a library with a Python module, such
library *must* be built as an Universal Binary; linking will fail
otherwise.

Building Pygame2
----------------
Now that all dependencies are built and installed, you can proceed to
build and install Pygame2 itself. You can either use the python way of
installing the package or the make command using the Makefile.

Simply type ::

  python setup.py install 

for the traditional python way or ::

  make install

for using the Makefile. This will try to perform a default installation
with as many features as possible.
