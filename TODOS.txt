- SDL_assert.h API - we do not really need that one
- SDL_gesture.h API
- SDL_haptic.h API
- SDL_mutex.h API - better be handled by multiprocessing and friends
- SDL_thread.h API - better be handled by multiprocessing and friends
- SDL_touch.h API
- SDL_syswm.h API

       pyobj = ctypes.py_object(val)
