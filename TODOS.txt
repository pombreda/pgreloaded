- SDL_assert.h API - we do not really need that one
- SDL_gesture.h API
- SDL_haptic.h API
- SDL_mutex.h API - better be handled by multiprocessing and friends
- SDL_thread.h API - better be handled by multiprocessing and friends
- SDL_touch.h API

- there seem to be random dead locks (with X11/GL related unit tests on
  Linux running in a VM - might be related to the heavy X11 context
  switches within the setUp() and tearDown() calls. The dead locks are
  caused by a futex(... FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE ...) call never returning...

- PyPy 1.8+ can't do
        val = "This is a value"
        pyobj = ctypes.py_object(val)
  at the moment, which breaks the unit tests for pygame2.sdl.log and others

- IronPython can't
        - handle function pointers correctly
        - deal with nested union assignemnts correctly (pygame2.sdl.events)
        - handle long/longlong conversions and ranges correctly (pixel access methods)
  at the moment, which breaks several unit tests

- Jython does not feature CPython 2.7 compatibility
